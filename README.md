# Python Beginner Playground
I made this repository to store some basic python projects; nothing fancy. The idea is to let python and other programming beginners know that the basics are important. 

## Projects?
Taking on projects as a newbie doesn't necessarily have to mean doing wild wild things.
A simple terminal app can go a long way into teaching you the ways.

Of course, to build a good portfolio, you would need the bloody wild things. But the basics are really necessary.

It doesn't matter how small the things you're building are. What matters most is that you're building them.
